# FAQ

# How do I use it?

take a look at the `demo` directory for a simple example.

## Does it pass the dogfood test?

No.

## Will it ever?

# What does the name stand for?

Something in Elvish, but I can't remember what. I was playing with a fantasy name generator and kept it as a cool name for a project.
